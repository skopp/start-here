Koding Projects
========

___
**Before we jump into Git, GitHub and all that confusing stuff (don't feel bad about it, everyone was a noob at what they do once),**
**we will instead focus on this Koding Projects repository __on__ Github itself.**

Because it's meant more to use Github as a platform _for **something**_ rather than for the sake of using Github for the sake of using Github
###That's it.
